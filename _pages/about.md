## Biography

A person passionate about data-driven decision making, machine learning, and LLM applications. I'm somewhat interested in finance and environmental protection. Maybe a inflexible product manager or a boring programmer in the future, who knows?

I can't resist cute things like fat fat shark, and the activity I enjoy the most is a dreamless sleep.
