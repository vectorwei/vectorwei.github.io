This is my first post, I want to talk about why I want to "waste" some time to build this site. It may not looked so fancy, but anyway: **Welcome to my site!**

### Getting lost
After being in Chicago for about half a year, I sometimes feel lost, unsure of what I’m doing or where my next stop is. I haven’t landed a summer internship in the US yet—just like many of my peers. But to be honest, I’m not the type to grind relentlessly like some of my Indian classmates who submit resumes and applications even during class breaks.

I’ve sent out around 300 applications. I know that’s not enough for an international student, but it’s still a decent number. I’m kind of confused about what’s going on—the worsening job market, ruthless capitalism, and even whether I’m really meant to stay in the US or go somewhere else. I always chat with my roommate, who has already decided to return to China. He has a girlfriend in Wuhan, and they’ve been together for 10 years, since middle school. It’s a nice story—maybe they’ll get married soon after he graduates. Who knows?

He always said that many Chinese students study tirelessly, competing for GPA, struggling through research papers, only to end up with jobs that pay around ¥10,000 a month. I also think: "For what?" But his words got me thinking—if I land a job at a big name like Amazon or Google, sure, people will be happy for me, they’ll respect me, they’ll see me as someone successful. But is there really a fundamental difference? Even with a high-paying job, you still can’t afford a house in Shanghai, you’re still afraid of getting laid off, and you’re still dealing with the pressures of work and marriage.
### Am I ready for a job?
In interviews, when they ask, "What are your strengths?" or "Why are you a good fit for this job?", I just recite my prepared answer: "I have a solid foundation in data science and machine learning. My projects and coursework have honed my skills in Python and SQL..." But I know it’s not impressive. I just don’t want to lie. I don’t have a fancy resume or extraordinary achievements that make people go "wow." I’m just me—an ordinary guy, an average person.


My roommate’s words and these interview questions make me think about what comes after I get a job. Am I really ready? I can already picture a life that’s stressful and overwhelming, with barely any time to learn new things. My insomnia has gotten worse—I can’t fall asleep...

Maybe I’m just overthinking. But I realize that every time I click "submit" on an application, or when people tell me "don’t worry about the job itself, just get one and get your foot in the door," I lose sight of what I’m actually good at, what I actually want. Is it the job title? The company name? I don’t even know anymore.

### Write something
So I want to write—write to keep myself awake, to clear my mind, to remind myself of what I truly want. I feel like I’m standing at a crossroads with more and more intersections ahead, aimlessly wandering, forgetting how to think.

This site is a place I build for myself, to stay clear-headed, to reflect, to get through sleepless nights. And, by the way, maybe it’ll help me train my English writing a little too.
